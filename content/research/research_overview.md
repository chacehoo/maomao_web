<div style="text-align: left"><font size="5">The overarching goal of our BIOR lab is to develop sustainable and scalable technologies and computational tools to make building and urban energy systems low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable. Our research is at the interface of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (i.e., Architectural Engineering), Computer Science, and Control Engineering. We employ a multifaceted approach that encompasses data analytics and machine learning, physics-based modeling and simulation, optimization and model-based optimal controls, as well as experiments. These approaches have been deployed across a spectrum of scales, spanning from equipment- through building- and community- to city-scale.</font> </div>

<div style="text-align: left"><font size="5">Currently, our lab is focusing on:</font> </div>
<font size="5">- Low-carbon building technologies for energy efficiency, flexibility, and climate resilience</font>
<font size="5">- Grid-interactive smart buildings and communities</font>
<font size="5">- Modelling, simulation, and model-based optimal control of building and urban energy systems</font>
<font size="5">- Physics-based modelling and control of HVAC&R systems</font>
<font size="5">- Data analytics and machine learning for buildings</font>
<font size="5">- Uncertainty analysis for buildings</font>
<font size="5">- Occupant behavior in buildings</font>
