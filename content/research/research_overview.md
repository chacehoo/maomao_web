<div style="text-align: left"> <font size="4">The overarching goal of our BIOR lab is to develop sustainable and scalable technologies and computational tools to make building and urban energy systems low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable. 

Our research is at the interface of Building Environment and Energy Engineering, Computer Science, and Control Engineering. We employ a multifaceted approach that encompasses data analytics and machine learning, physics-based modeling and simulation, optimization and model-based optimal controls, as well as experiments. These approaches have been deployed across a spectrum of scales, spanning from equipment- through building- and community- to city-scale.</font> </div>
