Our <span style="color:#EF7C00">Building Informatics and Operations Research (BIOR)</span> lab aims at developing sustainable and scalable technologies and computational tools to make building and urban energy systems low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable. 

Our interdisciplinary research is at the interface of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (i.e., Architectural Engineering), Computer Science, and Control Engineering. 

We employ a multifaceted approach that encompasses data analytics & machine learning, physics-based modeling & simulation, optimization & model-based optimal controls, as well as experiments. These approaches have been deployed across a spectrum of scales, spanning from equipment- through building- and community- to city-scale.
