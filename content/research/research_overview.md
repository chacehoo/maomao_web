Our <span style="color:#EF7C00">**Building Informatics and Operations Research (BIOR)**</span> lab aims at developing sustainable and scalable technologies and computational tools to make building and urban energy systems low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable. Our interdisciplinary research is at the interface of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (i.e., Architectural Engineering), Computer Science, and Control Engineering. We employ a multifaceted approach that encompasses data analytics & machine learning, physics-based modeling & simulation, optimization & model-based optimal controls, as well as experiments. These approaches have been deployed across a spectrum of scales, spanning from equipment- through building- and community- to city-scale.

Currently, our lab is focusing on:
- Low-carbon building technologies for energy efficiency, flexibility, and climate resilience
- Grid-interactive smart buildings and communities
- Modelling, optimization, and optimal control of building, district, and urban energy systems
- Modelling, optimization, and optimal control of HVAC&R systems
- Data analytics and machine learning for buildings
- Uncertainty analysis for buildings
- Occupant behavior in buildings
