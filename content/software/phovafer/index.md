# ‚≠ê About

---

- ‚ÄúPHOtoVoltAic FindER‚Äù (phovafer) is developed for identifying the solar photovoltaic (PV) users among the regular consumers on a  low-voltage distribution network. It contains the R functions for data representation, feature extraction, and PV users‚Äô classification using the extracted features. 

- This package is developed for the project "Analytical Middleware for Informed Distribution Networks (AMIDiNe)" (EPSRC: EP/S030131/1). The developers would like to thank for the help from Bruce Stephen, Jethro Browell, Rory Telford, Stuart Galloway, and Ciaran Gilbert from the University of Strathclyde.
