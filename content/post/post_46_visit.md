Earlier this week, Dr. Maomao Hu visited the [Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate](https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/E-ON-ERC-EBC/Das-Institut/~ewyi/Mitarbeiter/lidx/1/) at the E.ON Energy Research Center, RWTH Aachen University, in the tranquil and historic city of Aachen. The visit was kindly hosted by Prof. Dirk Müller and Dr. Rita Streblow.

During the visit, Dr. Hu had the pleasure of reconnecting with former visiting PhD student Nico Fuchs and was given an insightful lab tour by Tim Klebig and Jun Jiang. The tour showcased a wide range of advanced building technologies and experimental testbeds, including the Aircraft Ventilation Mock-up, a Ground Source Heat Pump system with 16 boreholes, a Combined Heat and Power plant, indoor climate chambers with radiant wall heating, and several Hardware-in-the-Loop test benches.

Dr. Hu also engaged in research discussions with Martin Rätz from the Building Automation group and Dr. Rita Streblow from the Digital Energy Neighborhoods group. He expresses his sincere gratitude for the warm hospitality and stimulating academic exchange throughout the visit.
