I am pleased to share that our recent review article **[Neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation techniques for managing demand-side flexibility in residential microgrids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120305372?via%3Dihub)** was published in *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*. Glad to see my last piece of work at PolyU coming out.
