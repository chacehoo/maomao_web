I am pleased to share that our recent review article **[Neighborhood-level coordination and negotiation techniques for managing demand-side flexibility in residential microgrids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120305372?via%3Dihub)** was published in *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*. Glad to see my last piece of work at PolyU coming out. 

Residential microgrid is a dynamic and complex cyber-physical system, which consists of multiple cooperative, non-cooperative and even conflicting entities. Harmonised coordination, not merely unorganised cooperation, among cooperative entities and negotiation among non-cooperative entities based on information sharing are needed to achieve the neighbourhood-level optimal solutions in a residential microgrid. Typical architectures for coordination and negotiation are classified into centralised, decentralised, hierarchical distributed, and non-hierarchical distributed architecture. Major coordination and negotiation techniques, including multi-agent system, optimisation and game theory, are reviewed and summarised.
