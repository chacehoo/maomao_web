It was a great pleasure to host (together with Adrian Chong) [Pieter de Wilde](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/pieter-de-wilde) from Lund University as well as [Alfonso Capozzoli](http://www.baeda.polito.it/people/lab_director/capozzoli_alfonso) and [Marco Savino Piscitelli](http://www.baeda.polito.it/people/members/piscitelli_marco_savino) from the Polytechnic University of Turin at the NUS College of Design & Engineering this week.

Pieter gave a talk sharing insights on AI and its implications for building simulation, making important connection to the building energy performance gap and the need to go beyond technological innovation towards real-world impact. 

Alfonso and Marco also gave a talk highlighting the challenges that MPC and DRL face in practice due to their complexity and lack of interpretability. They shared how their research addresses these challenges through techniques such as rule extraction, transforming complex control logics into transparent, transferable strategies.

The visit provided an excellent opportunity for our faculty, PhD students, and postdocs to exchange ideas, showcase their work, and explore potential directions for future collaboration.

A big thank you to them for their inspiring talks! We look forward to strengthening ties between our research labs!
