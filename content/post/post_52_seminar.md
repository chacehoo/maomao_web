Excited to host Professor Da Yan from Tsinghua University for a visit to our research group and the NUS Department of the Built Environment this week.

We were honored to have him deliver a guest lecture on "Leveraging AI for Optimizing Building Energy Systems: Practices and Explorations". He highlighted the importance of bridging AI technologies with building domain knowledge by sharing real-world deployments such as real-time occupancy detection, occupant number monitoring, and occupancy prediction for building energy efficiency improvement.

Thank you for dropping by, Da! Looking forward to more collaborations with your team.
