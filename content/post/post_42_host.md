Great to host the team from the Faculty of Architecture and Urban Planning, Chongqing University at NUS!

Prof. Chi Feng and colleagues from Chongqing University, along with 24 students, visited the IDEAS Lab led by Prof. Adrian Chong and our BIOR Lab. It was a fantastic day of knowledge exchange, student presentations, and discussions on sustainable and smart building technologies.

This visit truly strengthened our academic ties. Looking forward to more meaningful collaborations ahead!
