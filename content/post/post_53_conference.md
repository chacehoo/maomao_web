Our BIOR lab members had a fruitful week in Australia attending [Building Simulation 2025](https://bs2025.org/), 24-27 August 2025, in Brisbane and the UNSW–Tsinghua University joint workshop in Sydney.

Extremely proud of our current and past lab members - Muhammad Hafeez Saeed, Chengshen ZHANG, Xiaohan Shen, and Pengyu Jie - for delivering excellent presentations on a wide range of topics at the BS conference. Their works covered PINN-based building cluster modeling, urban wind–thermal environment simulation, optimal design of ventilation corridors, and optimal control of adaptive façades using DL surrogate models.

Dr. Hu also presented the joint work with QI LI on “Urban Spatial Microclimate Prediction with Morphological Map-based Ensemble Deep Learning Method”.

At the joint workshop hosted by UNSW and Tsinghua University on Climate-Resilient Buildings and Cities, Dr. Hu was honored to be invited to give a talk on “Living Labs: Empirical Exploration of Energy Efficiency and Flexibility in Campus Buildings”. Many thanks to Lan Ding for the invitation and thoughtful arrangements.

It was always wonderful to catch up with old friends, meet new colleagues, and exchange research ideas. Great experience in Australia!!
