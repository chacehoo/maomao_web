Dr. Hu visited the Politecnico di Torino üáÆüáπ last week for Roberto Chiosa‚Äôs PhD oral defense. Huge congratulations to him and to his advisors Alfonso Capozzoli and Marco Savino Piscitelli. It was a great honor to join Bing Dong, Fabio Favoino, Virginia Gori, and Clayton Miller as co-examiners.

Dr. Hu also had the chance to give a talk at the joint workshop ‚ÄúFuture Pathways for Grid-Interactive Buildings and Flexibility‚Äù together with Bing and Virginia. They had great discussions on the challenges and opportunities in grid-responsive building energy systems from advanced control strategies to their integration with future energy systems with a focus on portability, transferability, and interoperability.

Another highlight was meeting the talented PhD students at the [BAEDA Lab](http://www.baeda.polito.it/). Impressed by their impactful work on a wide range of topics, such as ontology-based graph knowledge for buildings, double-skin fa√ßades, urban-scale digital twins, and DRL for HVAC systems. 

Many thanks again to Alfonso Capozzoli and Marco Savino Piscitelli for making this trip possible and sooooo memorable, including the great coffee and pizza!
