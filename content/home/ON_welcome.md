Welcome to NUS BIOR Lab! We focus on data-driven optimization, learning, and control of multi-scale cyber-physical-human energy systems (from buildings to districts to cities) to make them smart, low-carbon, energy-efficient, demand-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable. Our work lies at the intersection of building science, computer science, and control engineering.
