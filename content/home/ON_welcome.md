Our BIOR lab focus on data-driven optimization, learning, and control of multi-scale cyber-physical-human energy systems (from buildings to districts to cities) to make them smart, low-carbon, energy-efficient, demand-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable.

Our interdisciplinary research is at the interface of Building Environment and Energy Engineering (i.e., Architectural Engineering), Computer Science, and Control Engineering.
