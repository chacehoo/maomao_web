<span style="color:#808080">Dr. Hu has served as the Deputy Director of the Center for Digital Building Technology since 2025. The center's primary mission is to enhance quality and productivity by leveraging digital building technologies to transform how people design, deliver, and manage the built environment. These technologies include augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), building information modeling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics and automation, video analytics, and digital twins, all supported by advanced equipment and devices.</span>

<span style="color:#808080">SDE4 is Singapore’s first new-build net-zero energy building, designed to exemplify human-centric and integrated sustainable development. Completed in 2019, the six-story structure incorporates passive design strategies, including a large overhanging roof and double facades on its east and west sides, to provide shading and minimize solar heat gain. Its hybrid cooling system enhances energy efficiency by maintaining comfortable indoor temperatures without excessive cooling. The building is powered by over 1,200 solar photovoltaic panels on its roof, generating more than 500 MWh of electricity annually to achieve a zero or positive energy balance. With a gross floor area of 8,514 square meters, SDE4 houses research laboratories, design studios, and community spaces, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration with public agencies and industry partners. Serving as a living laboratory, it plays a key role in advancing sustainable building technologies.</span>

<span style="color:#808080">The Smart Green Home is a cutting-edge indoor test-bed dedicated to advancing research and innovation in smart and sustainable living. This 100 m² full-size home provides a plug-and-play environment for testing smart features, green building technologies, and human-centric design solutions. Its reconfigurable structure enables flexible experimental setups, allowing researchers to study energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality, and sustainable home innovations. The facility also supports the exploration of novel materials, sensor-based control systems, and adaptive facades to enhance occupant comfort while optimizing energy performance.</span>

<span style="color:#808080">NUS operates multiple district cooling systems that efficiently cool buildings across its campus using centralized chilled water plants. This system produces and distributes chilled water through underground pipes to multiple buildings within a two-kilometer radius, eliminating the need for individual chiller plants and cooling towers. Heat exchangers optimize flow and regulate pressure, improving overall efficiency. By leveraging economies of scale and optimizing asset performance, district cooling reduces energy costs by up to 40% compared to traditional air-conditioning systems. Additionally, it lowers carbon emissions while enhancing grid reliability and climate resilience.</span>
