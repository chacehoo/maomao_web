Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Energy and Environmental Informatics Group, <a href="https://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Oxford e-Research Center</a>,  <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Department of Engineering Science</a>, University of Oxford. I joins Oxford and works with <a href="https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/david-wallom/" target="_blank"> Prof. David Wallom </a> as a Postdoc for the EPSRC funded project <a href="https://www.amidine.net/" target="_blank">AMIDiNe</a> since March 2020. I received my PhD degree in <a href="https://www.bse.polyu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Building Services Engineering</a> from <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/" target="_blank">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a> (PolyU) in 2019 (Supervisor: <a href="https://www.bse.polyu.edu.hk/People/befx/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Linda Xiao</a>). In 2018, I studied as a guest PhD student with [Prof. John Bagterp Jørgensen](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~jbjo/theses.html) in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/english) at the Technical University of Denmark. After my PhD, I continued to work as a postdoctoral research fellow at PolyU till February 2020. 

My research interests include data analytics, data-driven modelling, numerical optimisation, and model predictive control of building and urban energy systems for energy efficiency and energy flexibility.
