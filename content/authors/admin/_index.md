>UPDATE: I will be joining the National University of Singapore as an Assistant Professor in the Department of the Built Environment from January 2024, leading the <span style="color:#EF7C00">**Building Informatics and Operations Research (BIOR) Lab**</span>. I am currently looking for 2-3 Ph.D. students. Please check [<span style="color:#EF7C00">**Join Us**</span>](https://maomaohu.net/join/) page for more info.

Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Energy Science and Engineering, Doerr School of Sustainability, Stanford University since November 2021, advised by Prof. [Sally Benson](https://profiles.stanford.edu/sally-benson?releaseVersion=10.5.2). Prior to joining Stanford, I worked with Prof. [David Wallom](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/david-wallom/) as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Energy and Environmental Informatics Group, Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford for two years. I received my PhD degree in Building Environment and Energy Engineering from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2019, advised by Prof. [Linda Xiao](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/beee/people/academic-staff/professor-xiao-fu-linda/). In 2018, I studied as a guest PhD student with Prof. [John Bagterp Jørgensen](http://www.imm.dtu.dk/~jbjo/) in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark.

My research aims at developing sustainable and scalable technologies and computational tools to make today’s building and urban energy systems low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable. To achieve this overarching goal, I employs a multifaceted approach that encompasses data analytics & machine learning, physics-based modeling & simulation, optimization & model-based optimal controls, and experiments. These approaches have been deployed across a spectrum of scales, spanning from equipment- through building- and community- to city-scale. 

I have also been actively contributing to international collaborations, including the ongoing [IEA EBC Annex 81](https://annex81.iea-ebc.org/) (Data-Driven Smart Buildings) and [Annex 82](https://annex82.iea-ebc.org/) (Energy Flexible Buildings Towards Resilient Low Carbon Energy Systems).
