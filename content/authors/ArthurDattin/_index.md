Arthur Dattin is a visiting Master’s student in the BIOR Lab, jointly hosted by the Future Resilient Systems Laboratory at the Singapore-ETH Centre. He is completing an MSc in Mechanical Engineering at ETH Zurich with a specialisation in energy systems. Arthur’s research focuses on scalable control strategies data driven predictive control and market-oriented optimisation to unlock energy flexibility and provide ancillary services across large building clusters. 

He also serves as a research assistant in ETH’s Energy & Technology Policy group, where he studies technology-innovation pathways using patent-citation networks. Beyond the lab, Arthur enjoys running, skiing and exploring new destinations through travel.  He is also passionate about sailing and previously contributed to SP80, a Swiss venture aiming to break the world sailing speed record.
