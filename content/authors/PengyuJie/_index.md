Pengyu is a visiting PhD student in the BIOR Lab. His doctoral work examines how urban wind–thermal environments influence urban building energy use, and applies AI-based urban climate prediction for building performance optimization. Pengyu’s research interests include urban microclimate simulation and optimization, coupling UBEM with urban microclimate, and spatiotemporal analysis of urban building energy use. Outside of research, he enjoys street and nature photography, swimming, cycling, and fitness, and He also enjoys traveling with friends and recording the good life.
