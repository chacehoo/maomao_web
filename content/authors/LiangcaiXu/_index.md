Liangcai is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the BIOR Lab. He obtained both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University in 2018 and 2021, respectively, and earned his PhD from the National University of Singapore in 2025.

Before starting his PhD, his research primarily focused on modeling, robust control, and fault diagnosis for power electronics, with applications in fuel cell systems, including fuel cell electric vehicles and aircraft. During his doctoral studies, he tackled practical challenges in urban areas, where the rapid growth in electric vehicle adoption places significant strain on both power grids and charging networks. His work proposed an economic solution to help cities accommodate large-scale electric vehicle deployment.

Since joining the BIOR Lab, Liangcai has been dedicated to making buildings more efficient and sustainable by developing intelligent coordination strategies that integrate distributed assets such as electric vehicles, batteries, and on-site photovoltaic systems. In his spare time, he is an avid reader.
