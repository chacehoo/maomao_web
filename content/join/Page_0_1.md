Building Informatics and Operations Research (BIOR) Lab is directed by Dr. Maomao Hu, Assistant Professor of [the Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/), College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore. 

The overarching goal of our lab is to develop sustainable and scalable technologies and computational tools to make todayâ€™s building, district, and urban energy systems smart, low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable. We employ a multifaceted approach that encompasses data analytics and machine learning, physics-based modeling and simulation, optimization and model-based optimal controls, as well as experiments. These approaches have been deployed across a spectrum of scales, spanning from equipment- through building- and community- to city-scale.
