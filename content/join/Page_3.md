We welcome visiting students/scholars who are interested in collaborating with us. Ideally, students/scholars will be able to visit for a minimum of six months (preferably one year) to maximize the opportunity for collaboration and research. We can accommodate in-person/virtual visits but the funding is not guaranteed and self-funded visiting is preferred. If you are interested in exploring the possibility of working with us, please email Dr. Hu with a subject line as `Visiting_Application_{First Name}_{Last Name}`. Please check [here](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/prospective-students/non-graduating/research) for more information on the visting program as non-graduating research students at NUS.
