<div style="text-align: left"><font size="5"><span style="color:#EF7C00">**Building Informatics and Operations Research (BIOR)**</span> Lab is directed by Dr. Maomao Hu, Assistant Professor of [the Department of the Built Environment](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/dbe/), College of Design and Engineering, National University of Singapore.

The overarching goal of our lab is to develop sustainable and scalable technologies and computational tools to make todayâ€™s building and urban energy systems low-carbon, energy-efficient, energy-flexible, climate-resilient, and equitable. We employ a multifaceted approach that encompasses data analytics and machine learning, physics-based modeling and simulation, optimization and model-based optimal controls, as well as experiments. These approaches have been deployed across a spectrum of scales, spanning from equipment- through building- and community- to city-scale. Please check [here](https://maomaohu.net/#about) for more info about our research. 

We warmly invites applications from students with backgrounds in Building Environment and Energy Engineering (i.e., Architectural Engineering/HVAC&R Engineering),  Thermal Engineering (e.g., heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, etc.), Mechanical Engineering (e.g., fluid mechanics), Electrical Engineering, or Applied Mathematics.</font> </div>
